This procedure then brings up the Roll Editor GUI and populates it based off the data found in the current sheet (it'll get the property value, which is a string expression). The Roll Editor GUI keeps an internal memory of which property it's editing.\nThere'll be no need for a procedure when it closes, it'll simply save over the current sheet with the revised roll expression.</comment></block></xml>"
